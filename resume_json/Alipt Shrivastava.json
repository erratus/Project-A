    "Machine Learning Engineer | Fidelity International (2022 - Present) \u2014 Developed a Random Forest Classifier model to classify network risk zones, improving security accuracy to 94% and created a xgboost model to recommend firewall deployment with a 96% accuracy rate. Automated firewall rule generation, reducing manual effort by 80% and deployment time by 60%. Integrated continuous monitoring & feedback loops, retraining models for adaptive security enhancements. Developed an advanced multi-agent chatbot system leveraging LangChain and multiple state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemma2-9b-IT, and Mistral) for robust, general-purpose information retrieval. Integrated RAG-based Q&A using vector databases including FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma, and Astra DB to support context-aware, document-driven conversations across enterprise knowledge bases. Utilized HuggingFace embeddings and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for efficient chunking and semantic search optimization over a large corpus of enterprise documents. Designed and deployed intelligent multi-agent workflows using LangChain Agents (Zero-Shot ReAct, Few-Shot CoT) and agentic orchestration frameworks like LangGraph and CrewAI to facilitate modular task delegation and dynamic tool usage. Built a software tool for automating CISCO-ACI switch configurations, enhancing network efficiency by 30%. Created an automation solution for DNS record creation, reducing errors and improving accuracy by 95%. Developed a stock market prediction model using LSTM-RNN, achieving MSE = 0.032. Utilized genetic algorithm for hyperparameter tuning and Pearsons Correlation Coefficient for feature selection Lead data preprocessing & feature engineering, ensuring improved model efficiency. Developed a CNN-based model for human emotion recognition, enhancing classification accuracy."
